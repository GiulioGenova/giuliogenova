This community is all about bringing together all kind of R users spread across the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol located in the Dolomitic regions the heart of the European Alps.We started the group in May 2019 as a cooperation between the Institutes for Earth Observation and Alpine Environment at EURAC Research. Recently we are trying to include also other R-users from other scientific institusions, the private sector and also the hobby R programmers
