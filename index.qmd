Digital Soil Mapping Expert dealing with spatial modelling of soil properties, machine learning, High Performance Computing. As a PhD candidate in Mountain Environment and Agriculture at the University of Bozen/Bolzano in collaboration with Eurac research I was mainly interested in modelling the spatial distribution of soil properties, the role of trace metals in soil functioning, and water use efficiency in agriculture. I use a data science approach to answer scientific questions. I love open source software and open data.
